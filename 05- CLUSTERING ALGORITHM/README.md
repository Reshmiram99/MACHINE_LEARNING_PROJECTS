Iris Dataset Clustering Analysis
--------------------------------

Project Overview :
------------------
This repository contains an implementation of clustering algorithms applied to the classic Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques to identify natural groupings in the data without prior labeling.

Dataset:
--------
The analysis uses the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:

* Setosa
 
* Versicolor

* Virginica

Each sample contains four features:

1. Sepal length (cm)

2. Sepal width (cm)
 
3. Petal length (cm)
 
4. Petal width (cm)
   
Techniques Implemented :
-----------------------
The repository implements two popular clustering algorithms:   

1. KMeans Clustering
   
KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The implementation includes:

* Explanation of the KMeans algorithm
  
* Determination of optimal cluster number using the Elbow method
  
* Silhouette score analysis for cluster validation
  
* Visualization of cluster centroids and assignments
  
* Comparison with ground truth species labels

2.  Hierarchical Clustering
   
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters by progressively merging or splitting groups. The implementation includes:

* Explanation of the Hierarchical clustering algorithm

* Dendrogram visualization to determine optimal cluster count

* Comparison of different linkage methods (ward, complete, average, single)

* Cluster validation using silhouette scores

* Visualization of hierarchical cluster assignments

* Comparison with ground truth species labels

Key Features:
-------------
* Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature scaling

* PCA for dimensionality reduction to visualize high-dimensional data

* Detailed comparisons between clustering methods

* Beautiful visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

* Feature distribution analysis across clusters

* Performance evaluation using silhouette scores


Requirements:
--------------
The project requires the following Python libraries:

* numpy

* pandas

* matplotlib

* seaborn

* scikit-learn
 
* scipy


Installation:
-------------

1. Clone this repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-clustering-analysis.git
cd iris-clustering-analysis

2. Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
------
You can run the analysis by executing the Jupyter notebook:

bash

jupyter notebook iris_clustering_analysis.ipynb

Or run the Python script directly:

bashpython iris_clustering_analysis.py

Results:
--------
The analysis reveals that both KMeans and Hierarchical clustering successfully identify the natural groupings in the Iris dataset that correspond to the three different species. Some key findings include:

* Both algorithms effectively separate Setosa from the other species

* There is some overlap between Versicolor and Virginica in the clustering results

* Ward linkage performs best for hierarchical clustering on this dataset

* The optimal number of clusters (k=3) aligns with the actual number of species

Visualizations:
---------------
The repository includes several visualizations:

* PCA projections of the original data and cluster assignments

* Elbow method plot for KMeans optimization

* Hierarchical clustering dendrogram

* Comparison of clustering methods

* Feature distributions across clusters
